<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-28" alt="Chef Erika" src="http://sweetfool.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Chef-Erika-206x300.jpg" width="206" height="300" />What is Sweet Fool? Presently, Sweet Fool is my blog (and me, Erika. I am indeed a fool for sweets!) Previously, Sweet Fool was my cookie and confection business in Washington, D.C. until we decided to close up shop and move to Chicago to prepare for the birth of our son. He is my main obsession, but I also truly love to cook and am particularly enchanted with the sweet side. After earning an MBA from George Washington University and working in marketing for several years, I left the corporate world to attend pastry school and found my true passion while working with chocolate. That led me to work for an artisan chocolate shop for two years prior to starting my own business. Mainly obsessed with chocolate, I love any number of desserts, and on this website I will share my musings about all kinds of foodstuffs, mostly sweet but also savory, since you've gotta have both! I cook a lot, so I will share some of the things I'm making and offer tips I've picked up along the way. My culinary inspirations come from many places, from favorite treats from my childhood in California to the pâtisseries of my wonderful husband’s hometown of Paris. Yep, it's true, I'm maritally required to travel to France at least once a year. Bummer, I know. While I have no plans to re-open my business anytime soon, I would like to write a cookbook, so I plan to sort through ideas for that while writing this blog. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. Thanks for reading. Now let's go eat!
