Spring has sprung! Or so they say, although we are still waiting for it in Chicago. In the meantime, I am summoning spring with these cute little bird nests made of chocolate and shredded wheat. A popular Easter treat in the UK, these nests are easy to make and make a nice gift or a homemade addition to Easter baskets.
<h3>Chocolate Bird Nests</h3>
Yield: 7 to 8 bird nests

<strong>Ingredients:</strong>

6 oz. shredded wheat cereal (2 individually-wrapped packets of the original big biscuit from Post)
14 oz. dark or milk chocolate (ideally <a href="http://food52.com/blog/3601-how-to-temper-chocolate">tempered</a>)
16 mini chocolate eggs
8 pastel paper baking cups

<strong>Method:</strong>

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Set aside.

Using your hands, break up the shredded wheat biscuits in a bowl until they are all broken apart and resemble a pile of small twigs. A box of shredded wheat should contain several individually-wrapped packets of biscuits, weighing 3 ounces each. Each 3-ounce packet should yield 3 to 4 small nests and should require approximately 7 ounces of melted chocolate.

If you arenâ€™t using <a href="http://food52.com/blog/3601-how-to-temper-chocolate">tempered chocolate</a>, melt the chocolate, either over a <a href="http://food52.com/blog/3139-how-to-fake-a-double-boiler">double boiler</a> or in a glass bowl in the microwave at 50% power, first for one minute, then stir and repeat at 30-second increments until fully melted and smooth.

Pour the chocolate over the shredded wheat pieces and use a large spoon or spatula to mix it all together until every shred of wheat is covered in chocolate. Using a spoon (or latex-gloved hands) scoop some of the mixture (about the size of the inside of a paper baking cup) onto the lined baking sheet. Form it into rounded nest, then use your fingers to press an indention in the center for the eggs. Immediately press two or three chocolate eggs into the center, arranged to look like birds in a nest. Set aside to set at room temperature for about one hour. As they dry, the eggs should adhere easily to the nest. If you find that any eggs are loose, you can add more chocolate to the bottom of each egg and re-adhere to the nest to dry separately.

Place each nest inside a paper baking cup and wrap in cellophane to give as a gift or to use inside an Easter basket.
