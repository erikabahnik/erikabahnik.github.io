Yield: 30 to 35 cookies sandwich cookies, depending on how thick you roll the dough

<b>Ingredients:</b>

<b>For the cookies:
</b>¾ c. (12 Tbsp.) unsalted butter, softened
¾ c. confectioners' sugar
1 ¾ c. all-purpose flour
2 egg yolks
¼ tsp. vanilla extract
¼ tsp. fine salt
A two-inch heart-shaped cookie cutter
Melted, tempered chocolate for dipping

<b>For the filling:
</b>½ c. unsalted butter, softened
1 2/3 c. confectioners’ sugar
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1 Tbsp. milk
2 Tbsp. raspberry preserves, seeds strained if there are any (I use Bonne Maman preserves)

<b>Method:</b>

<b>Make the cookie dough:</b>

In the bowl of a stand mixer, use the paddle attachment to beat the butter until smooth. Add the confectioner’s sugar and ½ cup of the flour and mix for a few minutes until fluffy, periodically scraping down the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the yolks one at a time and mix until combined. Add the vanilla, salt and remaining 1 ¼ cups of flour, and mix to combine until a smooth dough forms. Divide the dough into two portions, pressing each into a round flat disk. Wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 30 minutes, until firm.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Once the dough is firm, remove one disk at a time from the refrigerator to roll out the dough. Place the disk you’re working with on a roomy countertop and open up the plastic wrap, but leave the dough on the wrap. (I like to put both on a large baking sheet so that I can more easily transfer the dough back to the refrigerator). Rub a bit of flour on your rolling pin and roll out the dough, starting from the center and rolling out, alternating angles, until it is evenly rolled out to 1/8 inch to ¼ inch high (depending on how thick you want your cookies). Transfer back to the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes to firm up the dough before cutting out the hearts. (Refrigerating this additional time will ensure that your cookie dough will be easier to work with and that your cookies will hold their shape).

<strong>Cut out cookie shapes:</strong>

Remove the rolled-out dough from the refrigerator and stamp out the cookies using the heart-shaped cookie cutter. Place the cookies one inch apart on a baking sheet lined with a silicone mat or parchment paper. Bake until the edges of the cookies are just turning pale golden, 14 to 15 minutes. Let cookies cool on the baking sheet.

Re-roll any remaining dough and refrigerate once again to firm up, repeating the process to cut out the remaining cookies.

<b>Make the filling:</b>

In a mixer, beat the butter until smooth and creamy. Add the confectioner’s sugar and vanilla and mix until combined and smooth. Add the milk and salt and continue beating until smooth again. Finally, add the strained raspberry preserves and mix to combine. It should be a pretty pink hue.

<strong>Assemble the cookies:</strong>

Place about a teaspoon of filling on the bottom of one cookie (I use a teaspoon-sized cookie scoop to make it easier).  Place another coookie on top and gently press them together to make a little cookie sandwich. Wipe away any filling that has squeezed out once the top cookie is added. Dip half of each cookie into <a href="http://food52.com/blog/3601-how-to-temper-chocolate">tempered chocolate</a> and shake off the excess. Place each cookie on a flat surface lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.

You can use this dough to make decorated cookies as well. I used some of my re-rolled dough to make some larger shapes that I decorated with frosting, sugar, <a href="http://www.indiatree.com/Subcategory_Page.php?Category=Decorating&amp;Subcategory=Dragees_Flowers">dragées</a>, and cinnamon sugar. Here are a few:
