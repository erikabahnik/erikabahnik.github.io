However, the basic peanut butter cookie left me wanting. It was usually more cookie, less peanut butter. The solution: Go flourless. Using organic peanut butter and only egg as a binder allows the pure peanut flavor to shine through. Omitting the flour also makes them naturally gluten free. In general, the French aren't fans of peanut butter, but they do like peanuts, so even my French husband loves these cookies. For those of you who have had my Sweet Fool Peanut Butter and Chocolate cookie, you will find that this is slightly different. This is the recipe I started with, but for Sweet Fool I developed a larger cookie that would more easily withstand packaging and travel. The recipe below is the version I make at home and is truly my favorite when I want a peanut butter fix.
<h3>Flourless Peanut Butter and Chocolate Cookies</h3>
Yield: 22 two-inch cookies
<h4><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h4>
1 c. organic creamy peanut butter (freshly ground is ideal, like at Whole Foods; otherwise look for a product where the only ingredients listed are peanuts and/or salt)
½ c. brown sugar, firmly packed
¼ c. granulated sugar
1 large egg, slightly beaten with a fork
½ tsp. baking soda
¼ tsp. fine sea salt
½ c. dark chocolate, chopped into small pieces (the size of chocolate chips)
<a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/tipstools/ingredients/2009/05/fleur_de_sel">Fleur de sel</a> (to sprinkle on top)
<h4><strong>Method:</strong></h4>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with silicone mats or parchment paper and set aside.

In the bowl of a stand mixer using the paddle attachment, mix together the peanut butter, sugars, egg, baking soda and salt until combined. Gently stir in the chocolate.

Use a tablespoon scoop to scoop the cookie dough, packing each cookie tight and leveling off. Place on the tray two inches apart. Use the bottom of a drinking glass to flatten the tops slightly (and gently). Replace any pieces of cookie dought that may have crumbled off after being pressed. Use a fork to make light criss cross marks on the top.

Bake at 350 degrees F until dry across the tops and lightly golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Sprinkle each cookie lightly with fleur de sel. Let cool for five minutes on the pans before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week.
