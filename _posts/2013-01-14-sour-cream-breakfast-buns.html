I have to have them, and yet month after month many of them continue to sit on the shelf, untouched. I decided to set a goal for the new year that by year's end, I will have made at least one new recipe from each cookbook. This is fairly ambitious, as I have over 60 cookbooks, so that's more than one recipe per week. To kick things off, I've started with something from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Magnolia-Bakery-Cookbook-Old-Fashioned/dp/0684859106/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358181537&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=magnolia+bakery">The Magnolia Bakery Cookbook</a>. Magnolia Bakery is one of New York's beloved bakeries that now has locations in Chicago and LA. This weekend I made their Sour Cream Breakfast Buns. These are essentially muffins, although the recipe calls for the creaming method of baking (beating together the cream and sugar) instead of the traditional muffin method (which includes melted butter or oil). The result is a more cakey texture with a finer crumb. I liken them to individual coffee cakes. Even if they weren't delicious, they would be worth making just to have the smell of toasted nuts, brown sugar and cinnamon filling the air. However, they ARE delicious, so all the better.

Yield: 21 regular-sized buns (original recipe says 18, but my batter made more)
<h4><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h4>
<strong>For the buns:</strong>

3 c. all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
1 1/2 tsp. baking soda
3/4 c. (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 1/2 c. granulated sugar
3 large eggs, at room temperature
1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
1 1/2 c. sour cream

<strong>For the topping:</strong>

1 1/3 c. light brown sugar, firmly packed
2 c. pecans, coarsely chopped
2 tsp. cinnamon
<h4><strong>Method:</strong></h4>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Butter the inside of 21 muffin cups by rubbing them with the inside of a butter wrapper (or you can use paper baking cups instead of greasing).

<strong>To make the buns:</strong> Cream together the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer, using the paddle attachment. Beat until fluffy, about three minutes. While the mixer is running, prepare your dry ingredients. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder and baking soda. Set aside.

Once the butter and sugar are light and fluffy, scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add one egg at a time, running the mixer after each addition. Scrape down the bowl again and add the vanilla extract. Mix once again before adding the dry ingredients. Mix only until just combined. (Do not overmix). Gently mix in the sour cream.

Fill each baking cup 3/4 full, using a cookie scoop or a spoon.

<strong>To make the topping:</strong> Mix together the brown sugar, chopped pecans, and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Sprinkle the topping evenly and generously over each bun, pressing down a bit so it adheres to the batter.

Place the muffin pans directly on the oven rack and bake at 350 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the middle of a center bun comes out clean. (For me, 22 minutes was perfect).

Store covered at room temperature for up to two days. (Note: Storing baked good in the refrigerator dries them out.)
