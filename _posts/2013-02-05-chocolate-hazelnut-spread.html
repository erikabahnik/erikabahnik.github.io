In honor of <a href="http://www.nutelladay.com/">World Nutella Day</a> (yes, there is such a thing), today's post is my recipe for chocolate hazelnut spread. The first time I made this, I was almost giddy. I love Nutella, and the idea that I could make it myself was very exciting. My homemade version is a little different from Nutella though. I use melted chocolate instead of cocoa powder, and I also use <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/product-spoligh-159336">grapeseed oil</a>, which is healthier than the <a href="http://www.saynotopalmoil.com/palm-oil.php">palm oil</a> found in Nutella. I also don't strain out the hazelnut particles (which would make it smoother), since for me, the more hazelnut the better. The great thing about making this yourself is that you know exactly what's going into it and there are no preservatives. This spread can sit on your counter in a covered jar for up to two weeks (if it lasts that long!).
<h3>Chocolate Hazelnut Spread</h3>
Yield: about 11 oz. (enough to fill a <a href="http://www.bonnemaman.us/">Bonne Maman preserves</a> jar)
<h4><strong>Ingredients</strong></h4>
2/3 c. toasted hazelnuts
8 oz. milk chocolate
2 Tbsp. confectioner's sugar
2 Tbsp. <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/product-spoligh-159336">grapeseed oil</a>
Â¼ tsp. vanilla extract
1 generous pinch of fine sea salt
Glass jar for storage (I like to use a clean <a href="http://www.bonnemaman.us/">Bonne Maman preserves</a> jar)
<h4><strong>Method</strong></h4>
Place the chocolate pieces in a medium metal or glass bowl that will sit comfortably on top of a small saucepan. Create a double boiler by bringing an inch of water to a simmer in a small saucepan. Keep heat on the lowest setting and place the bowl of chocolate on top, stirring until melted and smooth. Remove the bowl from the pan and rest on a kitchen towel, wiping the bottom of the bowl clean. Set aside to cool.

Put the hazelnuts in the bowl of a food processor and pulse a few times to chop the hazelnuts into smaller pieces. Then grind until the nut oils begin to release and a paste starts to form. You will need to stop and scrape down the bowl with a small spatula from time to time to reincorporate any mixture that adheres to the sides of the bowl. This process will take several minutes.

Once you have a smooth paste, add the oil and mix to combine. Then add the confectioner's sugar, vanilla and a pinch of salt and continue processing until the mixture is as smooth as possible. Add the melted chocolate and blend well. Pour the mixture into a glass jar, using a rubber spatula to get any bits still stuck to the bowl. Set aside to thicken and cool for several hours, ideally for a full day. (although it's certainly edible before that, this is just to achieve the desired texture). Store covered at room temperature for up to two weeks.
