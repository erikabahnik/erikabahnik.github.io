We always have some sort of dessert at our house. After all, my husband is French, and in France, dessert is NOT a course to skip! (I really love this about my in-laws). Some evenings I make dessert from scratch, but for the evenings I don't have time (which is pretty often), we need to have something on hand that can be prepared easily. One way to make store-bought desserts a little more special is to dress them up with a bit of a good chocolate sauce. Here is a foolproof recipe from <a href="http://www.davidlebovitz.com/">David Lebovitz</a> (acclaimed pastry chef and cookbook author). You can make it up in advance so it will be ready for an impromptu ice cream sundae, or to drizzle onto fruit or any kind of chocolate dessert. The possibilities are endless, really.

<h3><strong>Chocolate Sauce</strong></h3>
<em><a href="http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2005/12/the-best-chocol/">adapted from David Lebovitz</a></em>

Yield: About 1 1/4 cup
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">1/2 c. water
1/4 c. granulated sugar
1/4 c. light corn syrup (or agave nectar)
1/4 c. + 2 Tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder (preferably Dutch-processed)
1 oz. bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, finely chopped (use the good stuff!)</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Method:</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">In a medium saucepan, whisk together the water, sugar, corn syrup (or agave nectar), and cocoa powder. Bring to a boil over medium heat. As soon as the mixture starts to boil, remove it from the heat and stir in the chopped chocolate until melted. Set aside to cool and thicken for at least two hours before serving. (If you just can't wait, you can certainly use it before, but it will be awfully thin).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Store covered in the refrigerator and use within 10 days. If you have one, a squeeze bottle is a great method of storage for easy drizzling.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Reheat before serving.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Note: This is a veryÂ basic chocolate sauce, but you can customize it by adding flavorings to your taste. Start with 1/4 tsp. of your favorite spice, or spike it with 1 tsp. of Bourbon. Taste and adjust from there.</p>
