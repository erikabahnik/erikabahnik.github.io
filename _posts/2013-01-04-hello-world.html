Thanks for reading my first blog post! By way of introduction, my name is Erika and I live in Chicago with my amazing husband and young son. By trade, I am a marketing exec turned chocolatier, having left the corporate world to attend pastry school. After working for two years as a chocolatier for a small chocolate shop in Washington, D.C., I started my own business, Sweet Fool. My focus was on artisan cookies made with premium chocolate. The business wasn't open very long before I got pregnant, and we decided to close up shop and relocate to Chicago to prepare for our little one's arrival. Since then, I have been privileged to be a mom full time, and I am loving every minute of it. I have no immediate plans to re-open my business, but I continue to be obsessed with cooking, so I am turning my website into a blog to share some of my musings about dessert, chocolate, baked goods, and even some savory topics from time to time. I hope you will enjoy reading along! Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.
