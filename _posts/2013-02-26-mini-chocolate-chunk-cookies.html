There are times when you want an elegant dessert or one with sophisticated flavor combinations, and then there are times when you simply want to satisfy a sweet tooth with a favorite treat. This post is for the latter. Another cookie from my former Sweet Fool product line, these may look like your basic chocolate chip cookie, but a couple of elements make them a little more special. First, as in all my cookie recipes, instead of chocolate chips I use hand-chopped chunks of good quality chocolate. In this case, I use both milk and dark chocolate. Second, I add malted milk powder to give these cookies that unmistakable old-fashioned malt flavor. I made this batch mini size, but of course you can make them any size you want, you just need to bake them a little longer until they start to turn golden.
<h3><b>Mini Chocolate Chunk Cookies</b></h3>
Yield: 166 two-inch cookies
<h4><b>Ingredients:</b></h4>
2 c. all-purpose flour
1 tsp. baking soda
½ tsp. salt
1 c. butter
½ c. granulated sugar
¾ c. light brown sugar, firmly packed
¾ c. malted milk powder
1 egg
1 tsp. vanilla extract
5 oz. milk chocolate, roughly chopped into small pieces
5 oz. semi-sweet chocolate, roughly chopped into small pieces
<h4><b>Method:</b></h4>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. (Be sure to use parchment paper instead of a silicone mat for this recipe, or the cookies will spread too much).

In a medium bowl, measure out the flour, baking soda and salt. Whisk to combine.

In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter, sugars and malted milk powder for two minutes. Scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the egg and vanilla and mix to combine.

Add the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture in two batches, mixing just until combined after each addition and scraping down the bowl each time.  Stir in the chocolate pieces.

Using a teaspoon scoop, place scoops of dough onto the baking sheet, one to two inches apart. Bake at 350 degrees F for 9 to 10 minutes, or until the cookies just begin to turn light golden brown. Cool for three to five minutes on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
