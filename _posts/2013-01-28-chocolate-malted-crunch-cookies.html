If the name of these cookies sounds familiar, or conjures up delicious memories from your childhood, then perhaps you too are a lover of Thrifty's Chocolate Malted Krunch ice cream. To this day, it is one of my must-haves when I make a trip home to California. Thankfully Rite Aid has carried on the Thrifty's tradition. These cookies are my Ode to a Thrifty's Ice Cream Cone, but you don't have to know the ice cream to appreciate the age-old combination of chocolate and old-fashioned malt.
<h3>Chocolate Malted Crunch Cookies</h3>
Yield: 3 dozen 2 ½ inch cookies
<h4><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h4>
2/3 c. malted milk powder
1 ½ c. all-purpose flour
1 tsp. baking soda
½ tsp. fine sea salt
½ c. granulated sugar
½ c. light brown sugar, firmly packed
½ c. (one stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 large egg, at room temperature
1 tsp. vanilla extract
¼ c. Dutch-processed cocoa powder
5 oz. milk chocolate, chopped into small pieces
3 oz. dark chocolate, chopped into small pieces
1/3 c. <a href="https://www.ckproducts.com/products/4381/MALTED-MILK-CRISP-50-75-1950-/0">malted milk crisp</a> or malt ball centers or even crushed Whoppers candy
<h4><strong>Method:</strong></h4>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat and set aside.

In a medium bowl, sift together the malted milk powder, flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside.

Cream together the butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula, then add the egg and vanilla and mix to combine. Stir in the chocolate and malted milk crisp.

Using a tablespoon scoop, scoop the dough, level off, and place onto the baking sheet, two inches apart. Bake at 350 degrees F for about 12 minutes. The tops should be just set. Cool on the baking sheet for five minutes, then transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cool, the cookies should be crunchy on the outside and should give slightly in the center.

Store in an airtight container for up to one week.
