It's a new year, and the cold days in Chicago are finally upon us. Even though we are just coming off of the holiday indulgence, we still always enjoy a bit of dessert at our house. We are trying to go a bit lighter though, and hot baked apples are just the thing. I make them in the slow cooker* so they are deeply infused with sweetness and the warmth and spice of the cinnamon. These take just a few minutes to prepare. Then put them in the pot just before lunch and they are ready to serve with a dollop of ice cream after dinner. Baked apples aren't the prettiest things, but they sure do hit the spot on a cold winter evening.

* If you don't have a slow cooker, not to worry - you can just as easily bake apples in a 375 degree oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until tender but not mushy. Just add a scant cup of boiling water to the bottom of your baking dish before putting them in the oven.

<h3><strong>Slow-Cooked Cinnamon Raisin Apples</strong></h3>
Yield: 3 servings
<h4><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h4>
3 small to medium baking apples (choose your favorite variety), rinsed and cored
2 Tbsp. granulated sugar
1 Tbsp. raisins
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1 Tbsp. butter, diced

Special equipment: 1 quart slow cooker (I use a Crock-ette)
<h4><strong>Method:</strong></h4>
In a small bowl, mix together the raisins and sugar. Fill the center of the apples with the sugar mixture. Sprinkle the tops with cinnamon and dot with the butter. Place the apples in a slow cooker and add 1/2 cup water to the pot. Cover and cook for 7 hours, or until just tender. Serve warm in a bowl with your favorite ice cream.
