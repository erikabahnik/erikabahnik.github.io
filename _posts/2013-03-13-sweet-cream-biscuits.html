Ordinarily I reserve breakfast baking for weekends. However, this Monday we woke up to a rainy Chicago day that seemed perfect for a slow, leisurely morning. Normally I made classic southern buttermilk biscuits, but I had some heavy cream to use up, so I thought I would make sweet cream biscuits instead. As the name suggests, they are a bit sweeter than most breakfast biscuit recipes. The cream replaces the butter in terms of fat, which I think gives a good excuse to slather on extra butter while eating them.
<h3>Sweet Cream Biscuits</h3>
Yield: About 20 two-inch biscuits

<strong>Ingredients:</strong>

2 cups all-purpose flour
1 Tbsp. granulated sugar
1 Tbsp. baking powder
½ tsp. fine sea salt
1 ¼ c. heavy cream, chilled

<strong>Method:</strong>

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat and set aside.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Pour the cream over the dry ingredients and mix together with a fork until evenly moistened. Then turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead gently, just until the dough comes together and can easily be rolled out. Sprinkle the top of the dough gently and roll it out to about ½ inch thickness. Stamp out biscuits using a two-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter and place on the prepared baking sheet.

Bake at 425 degrees F for 12 to 15 mins, just until the biscuits have risen tall and the tops have turned light golden brown.

Serve warm, fresh from the oven. If you wish to freeze some, let them cool f irst, but then as soon as they are cool, put them in a plastic freezer bag and get them in the freezer, to retain as much of their original texture as possible.

<i>To reheat frozen biscuits:</i> Wrap them tightly in foil and heat them in a 300 degree F oven for 20 minutes (or 10 minutes if you have first allowed them to thaw at room temperature).
