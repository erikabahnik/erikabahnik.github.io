Every winter we keep a bowl filled with clementines. When we get an especially good batch (one that is particularly juicy, tart and fragrant), my husband says that he feels transported back to his childhood in Alsace. The latest batch to achieve this designation are mandarin oranges from California, thankyouverymuch (I'm a native Californian). These came with stems still attached. Maybe it's just coincidence, but I have found that the ones that retain their stems seem to be better than those that don't, particulary the Satsuma variety. We usually don't do anything special with clementines aside from eating them outright as a snack or dessert, although sometimes we juice them or use their fragrant zest in baked goods or on salads. Recently, however, I saw a Tweet from the <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/chocolate-dipped-clementines-recipe/index.html">Food Network</a> with the idea to dip them in chocolate. Since I am of the school of thought that believes that dipping something in chocolate almost always makes it better, I had to try it.
<h3>Chocolate-Dipped Clementines</h3>
This unique confection needs no formal recipe. Simply peel any variety and quantity of mandarin oranges that you like, pat each segment dry with a paper towel, and set them aside in a bowl while you melt some chocolate. Dark chocolate is best for this purpose, and ideally it would be <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-tempered-chocolate.htm">tempered,</a>*as the ones pictured above. I can do this easily at home since I have a tempering machine, but if you don't want to get into that, you can simply melt chocolate over a <a href="http://food52.com/blog/3139-how-to-fake-a-double-boiler">double boiler</a> or in the microwave at 50% power, stirring regularly, just until it is melted and smooth. As long as you don't heat it for too long, the chocolate will still harden pretty well without being tempered, but the dipped oranges should be consumed as soon as possible. In fact, even with tempered chocolate these should be enjoyed ASAP after dipping to avoid the segments from becoming dry. I sprinkled these with a bit of <a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/fleur-de-sel-french-sea-salt/">fleur de sel</a>, but it's not necessary. It just adds a bit of salty contrast with the sweet.

* Note: If you would like to try your hand at tempering chocolate by hand, <a href="http://food52.com/blog/3601-how-to-temper-chocolate">Food 52</a> recently posted the most easy-to-follow directions I've seen outside of my culinary textbooks. One little disclaimer/word of enouragement - Just know going in that even those of us who have learned to temper chocolate by hand in pastry school still don't temper chocolate perfectly every time. Chocolate is a temperamental ingredient, and sometimes for whatever reason, it falls out of temper. So be patient, follow the directions exactly, and surely you will find success tempering chocolate.
