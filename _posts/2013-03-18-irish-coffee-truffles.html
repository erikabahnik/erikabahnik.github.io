Truffles are a rich chocolate confection made by combining chocolate, cream and/or butter, and flavorings. They get their name from their resemblance to savory truffles, the cherished fungi found several inches underground near the root of certain trees. I made this Irish coffee variety by adding Bailey’s Irish Cream (the hazelnut version) and Galliano Ristretto, a wonderful coffee liqueur. Adding a bit of coffee to chocolate recipes intensifies the chocolate flavor, but when you add a little more you get a nice mocha flavor, as you will find here. Rich and decadent, these truffles can satifsy your chocolate craving in a single bite.
<h3><b>Irish Coffee Truffles</b></h3>
Yield: 60 1-inch truffles

<b>Ingredients:</b>

6 oz. heavy whipping cream
10 oz. dark chocolate, chopped
5 oz. milk chocolate, chopped
1 oz. (2 Tbsp.) unsalted butter, softened
1 oz. (2 Tbsp.) Bailey’s      Irish Cream Liqueur
½ oz. (1 Tbsp.) coffee liqueur (I use Galliano Ristretto)
Cocoa powder for coating the truffles (preferably Dutch processed, the darkest you can find)

<b>Method:</b>

Melt the chocolates together gently, either over a <a href="http://food52.com/blog/3139-how-to-fake-a-double-boiler">double boiler</a> or in a glass bowl in the microwave at 50% power, first for one minute, then stir and repeat at 30-second increments until fully melted and smooth. Set aside.

Heat the cream in a saucepan over medium heat until quite hot.  Remove from heat and stir into the melted chocolate.  Stir in softened butter until it is fully incorporated and there are no lumps.  Stream in the two liqueurs gradually, stirring to combine.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside to cool a bit before putting in the refrigerator to firm all the way.

Use a spoon to scrape up a few strips of ganache at a time, then use the palms of your hands to roll them into balls. Roll the truffles in cocoa powder, coating them well. Serve at room temperature.
