For me, there is something so comforting about baked apple desserts, especially during the cold months. After making all kinds of desserts, sometimes I just want a simple comfort dessert. This apple crostata takes a little bit of prep work, but it is actually very easy. It is a nice baking project for those lazy winter weekends, or in this case for me, a weekday when we were snowed in. The crumble topping makes it a little more decadent and exciting than a simple apple tart.
<h3>Apple Crostata</h3>
Yield: 8 wedges
<strong>
Ingredients:</strong>

<strong>The pastry:</strong>

1 c. all-purpose flour
2 Tbsp. granulated sugar
¼ tsp. fine sea salt
1 stick (4 oz.) unsalted butter, cold and diced
2 Tbsp. very cold water

<strong>The apple filling:</strong>
2 to 3 large Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and cut into eighths
¼ c. all-purpose flour
¼ c. granulated sugar
¼ tsp. fine sea salt
¼ tsp. cinnamon
1/8 tsp. nutmeg
½ stick (2 oz.) unsalted butter, cold and diced

<strong>Method:</strong>

<strong>For the pastry:</strong> Put the flour, sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse a few times to combine. Add the cold, diced butter. Pulse another several times, until the butter is the size of peas. While running the processor, add 2 Tbsp. cold water all at once through the opening at the top of the processor. Pulse to combine, stopping just before the dough comes together. Flour a work surface and turn the dough out onto it. Form the dough into a disk, cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour.

Once the dough is sufficiently chilled, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough into a 10 to 11-inch circle. Transfer it to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Set aside while you prepare the apple filling.

<strong>For the filling:</strong> cut the apple wedges in half and arrange on the pastry dough, leaving a 1½ inch border.
Combine the flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in the bowl of a food processor or mixer. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture is crumbly. Rub the pieces a bit between your fingers to make it really crumbly. Sprinkle the filling evenly over the apples. Fold the pastry border over the apples, pleating it where necessary to make a circle.

Bake the crostata for 25 to 30 minutes, until the crust is golden and the apples are tender when pierced with a paring knife. Allow to cool before cutting into eight wedges and serving.
