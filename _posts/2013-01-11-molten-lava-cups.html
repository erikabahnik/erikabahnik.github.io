Anyone who has been to dinner at my house more than a couple of times has surely had this. My most common go-to dessert, these molten lava cups are a cross between a molten lava cake and a soufflé. Rich and chocolatey, they are not for the faint of heart. They are quick and easy to prepare, making them perfect for an everyday dessert; but they also present well in individual portions, so they are special enough to serve at a dinner party.
<h3>Molten Lava Cups</h3>
Yield: Two 4 oz. desserts
<h4><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h4>
4 oz. (½ stick) unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing the baking cups
2 oz. good chocolate, semi-sweet or bittersweet, chopped into small pieces
1 egg
6 Tbsp. light brown sugar
1 1/2 Tbsp. all-purpose flour
Pinch of salt
Ice cream or confectioner's sugar for serving
<h4><strong>Method:</strong></h4>
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Butter the inside of two 4 oz. round ramekins (Tip: I save butter wrappers in the refrigerator for this purpose). If you don't have ramekins, oven-safe coffee cups work nicely, but you must use something with a couple inches of depth. Put the ramekins inside a metal or glass baking dish and set aside.

Make a ganache by melting together the chocolate and butter. If you are accustomed to working with a double boiler, you can do that (put the chocolate and butter in a bowl that rests on top of a saucepan with one inch of water simmering gently beneath), or what I do these days is melt them in the microwave, which works like a charm. In this case, put the chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl and heat for one minute at 50% power (to avoid burning the chocolate). Stir and repeat at 30 second intervals until the chocolate and butter are melted and the ganache is smooth. Set aside to cool a bit.

While the ganache cools, whisk together the egg and brown sugar in a medium bowl. Add the flour and salt and whisk until fully blended. Now it's time to add the chocolate to the egg mixture, which requires a bit of tempering to ensure that you don't end up with scrambled eggs. To do this, swiftly whisk the egg mixture while adding about 1/4 of the chocolate mixture. Whisk quickly until combined, then keep whisking quickly as you slowly add the rest of the chocolate. Once the two mixtures are smoothly combined, they are ready to pour into your ramekins and bake. The mixture should fill the ramekin (it won't reach as high in a coffee cup).

Put the baking dish with the ramekins in the oven and bake at 400 degrees F for 18 to 20 minutes, or until the top looks like the top of a brownie and the edges have some structure. The chocolate underneath will ooze and there will be just a bit of a cakey edge around the sides of the cup. Use oven mitts or a rubber tipped pair of tongs to remove each ramekin carefully from the baking dish.  Put each ramekin directly on a small plate. Top with a dusting of confectioner's sugar or your favorite ice cream (or both, because why not?). Serve immediately, warning guests that the ramekin is still hot.
