My husband’s birthday was on Tuesday, and this year instead of a cake I decided to make a special plated dessert instead. We have fond memories of enjoying different versions of tiramisu (which means "pick me up" in Italian) on a trip to Italy a few years ago. After we returned home, I must have tried out three or four different recipes for this classic Italian dessert, and one of those was <a href="http://www.giadadelaurentiis.com/">Giada DeLaurentiis</a>'s chocolate tiramisu. I am a little wary of raw egg mixtures (which many tiramisu recipes call for), so I like that the eggs are heated to a safe temperature before being used in this dessert. The first time I made it, I stayed true to Giada’s recipe exactly, and it was irresistible. This time, though, I wanted to mix things up a bit, so I made individual portions in wine glasses (her recipe calls for layering the dessert in a loaf pan), and I substituted Bailey’s Irish Cream (with hazelnut flavoring) for the traditional Marsala. The result is decadent and creamy, and I have to admit that while I made two portions of tiramisu for the birthday dinner, I didn’t even bother with the ladyfingers or espresso for our leftovers the next night. We simple enjoyed the zabaglione and cream mixture spooned into a bowl like a thick pudding. Absolutely delectable.
<h3>Chocolate Tiramisu</h3>
<i>Adapted from Giada DeLaurentiis’s recipe from her cookbook, <a href="http://www.giadadelaurentiis.com/products/5/everyday-italian">Everyday Italian </a>
</i>

Yield: About 6 substantial dessert portions

<b>Ingredients:</b>

8 oz. mascarpone cheese
¾ c. heavy whipping cream
2/3 c. granulated sugar
2 ½ c. cold espresso (I used Nespresso Ristretto, a dark roast)
24 ladyfinger cookies (recommended: Savoiardi)
Unsweetened cocoa powder, for sifting on top

<b>For the chocolate zabaglione:</b>

2 Tbsp. heavy whipping cream
¼ c. dark chocolate pieces
1/3 c. granulated sugar
1/3 c. Bailey’s Irish Cream (with our without a hint of hazelnut)
4 large egg yolks
Pinch of salt
<h4><strong>Method:</strong></h4>
<b>Making the zabaglione</b>

Several hours before you wish to serve this dessert (and ideally the day before), make the chocolate zabaglione.

Put 2 tablespoons of heavy cream in a small microwavable bowl and heat for 15 to 20 seconds, or until the cream is warm. Set aside. Melt ¼ cup of chocolate pieces in a small glass bowl by microwaving for one minute at 50% power. Stir and continue melting and stirring in 15-minute increments (always at 50% power) until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Whisk in the warm cream and set aside to cool.

In a two-quart saucepan, bring about two inches of water to a simmer.

In a metal bowl which is the right size to rest comfortably atop the saucepan of simmering water, whisk together the egg yolks, 1/3 cup of sugar, Bailey’s and a pinch of salt. Place on top of the saucepan of water (which should be simmering on low), and whisk constantly for several minutes until the mixture is thick and the temperature reaches 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. At that time, remove the mixture from the heat, wipe the bottom of the bowl dry with a clean kitchen towel, and gently fold the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture using a rubber spatula. This is the chocolate zabaglione. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least two hours but ideally longer (up to one day).

<b>Preparing the cream to be mixed with the zabaglione</b>

Put the mascarpone cheese in a large bowl and gently stir with a rubber spatula, just enough to smooth it out a bit. Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer using the whisk attachment (or you could use a hand mixer), beat ¾ of heavy cream and 1/3 cup granulated sugar on high speed until it thickens to <a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/tipstools/tips/2008/04/how_to_beat_egg_whites">soft peaks</a>. Fold the sweetened whipped cream into the mascarpone cheese gently with a spatula. Then fold in the chocolate zabaglione (also gently, to avoid lumps from forming). Cover and refrigerate.

<b>Assembling the tiramisu</b>

Now you are ready to assemble your desserts (unless you want to forget the tiramisu and just eat that amazing cream mixture!). Set out six wine glasses. Whisk the remaining 1/3 cup of sugar into the espresso and place it in a shallow dish (like a baking dish). Dip one ladyfinger at a time for a few seconds so it absorbs some espresso (but not too much). Shake off any excess espresso, break the cookie in half and place the two pieces into the bottom of a wine glass. Repeat with another cookie. Top the espresso-soaked ladyfingers with a couple heaping spoonfuls of the cream mixture. Dip another two cookies and make a second cookie layer. Then add another couple spoonfuls of the cream. Top each wine glass with a square of plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least a couple hours and up to one day before serving. When you are ready to serve the dessert, sprinkle the top with cocoa powder.
