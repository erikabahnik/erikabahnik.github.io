Since my in-laws are visiting from Paris for Easter, I wanted to present them with something special to celebrate this important holiday. My husband told me about a French tradition at Easter of filling a large chocolate egg with smaller chocolates, mostly in the shape of seashells and fish, but also a few traditional Easter shapes. I made a dark chocolate egg with a design on top, which I accented with gold luster dust. I filled the inside with milk chocolates (my mother-in-law's favorite) and white chocolates (my father-in-law's favorite) in the shapes of seashells, fish, seahorses, and also bunnies, lambs and eggs. To present the egg, which measures about 5 x 4 x 2 inches, I wrapped a small box and its top (a shoebox of my son's) in pretty spring paper. The egg is resting on a bed of Easter grass. I look forward to giving it to them on Easter morning!

Once again, Happy Easter! I'll be back next week with some springtime posts.
