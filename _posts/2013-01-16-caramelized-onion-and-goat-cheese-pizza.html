Today it's all about pizza! We do Pizza Friday at our house, and that means that we dress and bake our own. Usually we buy a ready-made crust, one of our favorites being the artisan thin crust from Freschetta. Many of our pizzas feature the usual suspects - salami/pepperoni or ham with Kalamata olives/mushrooms, artichoke hearts and Roma tomatoes, or Greek pizza, but every now and then I opt to make something without the red sauce, and that's what we did this past Friday. Nice for a change and full of flavor, this combination would also be well suited as an appetizer flatbread when expecting friends. Just slice it into squares and serve on a platter.
<h3><strong>Caramelized Onion and Goat Cheese Pizza</strong></h3>
Yield: 8 slices
<h4><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h4>
One pre-baked pizza crust
1 cup grated mozzarella cheese
1 Tbsp. roasted garlic, minced (or if you must, you could substitute 1/2 tsp. garlic powder; just sprinkle it on top of the oregano instead of directly onto the crust)
1 to 2 oz. crumbled goat cheese (depending on how much you like goat cheese)
1 Tbsp. olive oil
Half of one medium white or yellow onion, thinly sliced
1/4 tsp. kosher salt
Dried oregano, to taste
<h4><strong>Method:</strong></h4>
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Put pizza crust on a pizza pan or baking sheet and set aside.

Heat 1 Tbsp. olive oil in a 10-inch saut√© pan over medium low heat. Once the oil is fairly hot, add the sliced onion to the pan with 1/4 tsp. kosher salt. Stir frequently with a wooden spoon until the onion turns translucent and subsequently begins to caramelize to a light golden brown. Once it is all caramelized, take the pan off the heat.

To assemble your pizza, spread the roasted garlic evenly over the crust. Sprinkle the grated mozzarella evenly over the garlic. Place the caramelized onion evenly over the mozzarella, and then drop a small crumble of goat cheese all over the top, every one to two inches. Shake dried oregano over the top, to your taste.

Bake at 425 degrees F for 10 to 12 minutes, until the edges are golden brown. Slice into eight slices and serve immediately.
