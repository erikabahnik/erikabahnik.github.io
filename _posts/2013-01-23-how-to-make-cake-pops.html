First the craze was cupcakes. Then cake pops. Suddenly they seemed to pop up everywhere. Even Starbucks has them now. And why not?  They're cute and fun and a particularly festive treat to serve at parties and showers. There are so many things you can do with them, from different flavors to fun colors and decorations. But did you also know that they are super easy to make? Really. You don't need to order these from a specialty cake shop or spend lots of money on hard-to-find ingredients or specialty cake pop pans (These days there's a product out there for everything, and you don't need 'em!). Everything you need you can find at your basic grocery store, even the candy coating and treat bags. Then just follow my straightforward instructions to make your own cake pops.
<h3>Cake Pops</h3>
Yield: 20 1 ½ inch cake pops
<h4><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h4>
Half of a 9 x 13 inch cake, any flavor * (I used 6 gingerbread cupcakes using <a href="http://www.framedcooks.com/2012/04/gingerbread-cupcakes-with-cinnamon-cream-cheese-frosting.html">this recipe from FramedCooks.com</a>)

Frosting, any flavor that complements the cake (I used the matching cinnamon cream cheese frosting from <a href="http://www.framedcooks.com/2012/04/gingerbread-cupcakes-with-cinnamon-cream-cheese-frosting.html">FramedCooks.com</a>); amount will depend on how moist your cake is. Mine was very moist so I used minimal frosting, just a couple dollops with a regular spoon.

10 oz. <a href="http://www.wilton.com/store/site/product.cfm?id=33646816-1E0B-C910-EAB02ACAEFACDB72">Wilton Candy Dips</a> (or you can use chocolate, following the same instructions for melting)

20 cookie sticks

Decoration of your choice - for my gingerbread pops, I sprinkled the tops with cinnamon sugar. You could use any type of sprinkle, spice, chips, or whatever else you want to suit your need.

A piece of styrofoam or cardboard box large enough to stick the cake pop sticks through while they set up

Treat bags and ribbons (optional, if you want to package them individually)

* I did use a homemade cake for this since I had frozen one that I made around Christmastime, but you do not need the best quality cake for cake pops. A boxed mix is fine. After all, you're going to mix frosting into it, so using really good cake would be like using top shelf liquor to make a foofy mixed drink -- nice if you can afford it, but not necessary.
<h4><strong>Method:</strong></h4>
Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or sheet or parchment and set aside.

Have your styrofoam block or cardboard box handy. If you're using a cardboard box, make holes in the top of the box to accommodate your sticks. I used an ice pick to make the first hole, then used it to widen the hole until it was just the right size to insert the cookie stick without its moving around. Leave two inches between each hole so the cake pops don't bump into each other while drying.

In a large bowl, crumble the cake with your hands until you have fine, even crumbs. Add frosting, a spoonful at a time, using your hands to mix into the cake crumbs. Use the frosting sparingly. You only need enough to make the cake stick together when rolled into a ball. Add too much and you'll have a goopy mess. Use a cookie scoop to measure out even pops. I found a 1 1/2 Tbsp. cookie scoop to be the perfect size. Pack the cookie scoop full and level it off before removing the cake mixture. Roll into a ball and place onto the lined baking sheet. Once all the cake pops are rolled, put the baking sheet with the pops into the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes to firm up.

A few minutes before you plan to remove the cake pops from the freezer, prepare your candy coating. Put the candy dips in a short but narrow drinking glass or a small glass bowl. Put in the microwave at 50% power for 1 minute. Stir with a rubber spatula. Return to the microwave for another 30 seconds at 50% power, and stir again. Repeat until the coating is completely melted and smooth. Now you will need to work fast, as the coating hardens rather quickly. You may want to remove the cake balls from the freezer just a few at a time, so the last ones aren't too soft by the time you try to dip them.

To dip the first cake pops, first insert the end of the cookie stick into the candy coating, covering the last 1/2 inch of the stick. Immediately press the stick into the cake pop about halfway or until it is secure. Hold the stick and dip the cake pop into the candy coating. If you want the surface of the cake pops to be perfectly smooth (which I'll warn in advance is a bit tricky with this kind of candy coating), dip them straight down until they are fully submerged, them remove by pulling straight up, then let any excess coating drip off. I prefer to have a bit of a swirl pattern on my cake pops, so I swirl them a bit into the candy coating, and then use my finger to create swirly lines in the coating while twirling the stick in the other hand. Once you remove the cake pop from the coating or finish your swirls, add any toppings before you place them into the box to dry.

Once the cake pops are completely dry, put them into treat bags and tie with a ribbon (see photo above).
