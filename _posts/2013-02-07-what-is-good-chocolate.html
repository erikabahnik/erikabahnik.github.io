<h3><b>Ingredient Profile: Chocolate</b></h3>
I often make reference to “good chocolate” when talking about chocolate as an ingredient, which naturally begs the question: “What IS good chocolate?” Let me shed some light here. Chocolate is an agricultural product, and like wine or coffee, there are many factors that affect its quality. Since I’m sure many people’s eyes would start to glaze over if I launched into a conversation about bean fermentation and conching, I will spare you the details and instead talk about two basic but important elements of good chocolate that are the easiest to look for:
<h4><b>High cocoa percentage: </b></h4>
In the U.S., the FDA requires that dark chocolate must contain at least 35% cocoa solids (and this is quite low). Semi-sweet chocolate has between 35 and 59% cocoa content. Anything under 50% will have a weaker chocolate flavor, while a cocoa content of over 60% is considered bittersweet chocolate.  The greater the percentage of cocoa solids, the less sugar and thus the more complexity in the flavor, as you will taste the chocolate more than the flavorings.
<h4><b>Presence of cocoa butter vs. oil:</b></h4>
Good chocolate contains pure cocoa butter (a bi-product of chocolate making) instead of vegetable oils, which are less expensive. Without cocoa butter, most chocolate aficionados (myself included) don’t consider that product real chocolate.

Beyond these factors, the ultimate deciding factor is your personal preference. Obviously you should eat what tastes good to you, and the more kinds of chocolate you taste, the broader your palate will become so that you will more easily recognize different flavor profiles in chocolate.
<h4><b>Chocolate recommendations:</b></h4>
I like many chocolates, but here are a few recommendations that may help you with your everyday baking and cooking. If you are looking for a chocolate to use as a coating, ideally you should use a fine couverture (French for “coating”). Couverture is the kind of chocolate most often used in fine candy making. I use <a href="http://www.belcolade.com">Belcolade</a> chocolate coins when I need tempered chocolate, and I even use it for ganaches or to chop up to use in baked goods instead of commercial chocolate chips.  The best price I have found without buying in bulk is at <a href="http://www.worldwidechocolate.com/">WorldWideChocolate.com</a>. I usually buy either the Noir Selection (semi-sweet) or Noir Superieur (bittersweet). I have also found the flavor of their milk chocolate to be far superior to other brands.

A chocolate that I frequently use also for those latter purposes (i.e. for cooking rather than coating) is oddly enough from <a href="http://www.traderjoes.com/">Trader Joe’s</a>. Their <a href="http://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer/article.asp?article_id=362">Pound Plus bars</a> are actually quite good. The semi-sweet dark chocolate contains 54% cocoa solids, the milk chocolate contains a respectable 33% cocoa solids, and they even have a bittersweet that contains 72%.

When I’m really in a pinch and need to settle with a grocery store brand for baking, I prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ghirardelli-Chocolate-Baking-Bittersweet-10-Ounce/dp/B004YVOFB6/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360270692&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=ghirardelli+chips">Ghirardelli chips</a>, particularly the 60% ones. They are bittersweet and thus a little more intense in flavor than the semi-sweet chips, so if you prefer a sweeter chocolate you might try their semi-sweet, milk chocolate, or even white chocolate varieties.
<h4><strong>Common Chocolate Terms Defined: </strong></h4>
The following descriptions may help further your understanding of what makes up a bar of chocolate. This list is from <a href="http://www.thestoryofchocolate.com/Savor/content.cfm?ItemNumber=3454&amp;navItemNumber=3376">TheStoryofChocolate.com</a> because I couldn’t have said it better myself.
<ul>
	<li><b>Cacao</b>: Refers to the bean, which is the source of chocolate liquor, cocoa butter and cocoa powder.</li>
	<li><b>Chocolate Liquor</b>: Produced by grinding the center of bean, called the nib, to a smooth, liquid state. Chocolate liquor is also called chocolate, unsweetened chocolate, baking chocolate, bitter chocolate, cocoa solids, cocoa mass, cacao mass and cocoa paste.</li>
	<li><b>Cocoa Butter</b>: The fat naturally present in cacao beans that melts at body temperature and gives chocolate its unique mouthfeel.</li>
	<li><b>Cocoa or Cocoa Powder</b>: The product made by pressing most of the cocoa butter out of the cocoa bean and grinding the rest to a powder. Under U.S. regulations, “cocoa” and “cocoa powder” can be used synonymously.</li>
</ul>
