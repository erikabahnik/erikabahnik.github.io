As I eagerly await the start of strawberry season so I can share some of my favorite strawberry desserts, I thought I would share a Sweet Fool cookie recipe that is perfect for spring brunches, showers or any kind of dessert table. This is the only cookie in my product line that didn't feature chocolate, and it had an almost obsessive following among customers and friends. A soft cookie with a slightly cakey texture, these light and airy cookies should be enjoyed as soon as possible after making them, since they start to lose their tender texture after just a couple of days. To achieve the unique flavor of the Sweet Fool cookie, you should use the <a href="http://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/fiori-di-sicilia-1-oz">Fiori di Sicilia oil </a>that I mention from King Arthur Flour. It combines citrus notes with a hint of vanilla, reminiscent of Italian panettone.
<h3>Citrus Mascarpone Cookies</h3>
Yield: approximately 22 cookies

<b>Ingredients:</b>

<strong>For the cookies:</strong>
1 c. plus 2 ½ Tbsp. cake flour
½ tsp. baking powder
½ tsp. fine sea salt
2 oz. (½ stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 c. granulated sugar
1 egg, at room temperature
4 oz. mascarpone cheese, at room temperature
¼ tsp. <a href="http://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/fiori-di-sicilia-1-oz">Fiori di Sicilia oil</a> (or you can substitute another lemon or orange oil, or 3 Tbsp. freshly squeezed lemon or orange juice)

<strong>For the citrus glaze:</strong>
1 c. confectioner’s sugar
1 Tbsp. corn syrup
2 Tbsp. water
1/8 tsp. Fiori di Sicilia oil (or you can substitute another lemon or orange oil, or 1 ½ Tbsp. freshly squeezed lemon or orange juice.  If using fruit juice, omit the water.)

<b>Method:</b>

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

<strong>To make the cookies:</strong>
In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add the egg, mixing until incorporated. Scrape down the bowl, then add the mascarpone cheese and citrus oil or lemon/orange juice.  Mix on low just until incorporated.  Stir in the dry ingredients with a rubber spatula.

Line two baking sheets with parchment paper (do not use a Silpat or a greased cookie sheet, as these cookies will spread awkwardly).  Using a tablespoon-sized scoop, scoop the dough onto the baking sheets, 2 to 3 inches apart (usually just 3 rows of 3, since these cookies spread quite a bit). Bake at 375 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes, or until slightly golden at the edges. Remove from the oven and let the cookies rest on the baking sheet for 20 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

<strong>To make the citrus glaze:</strong>
Combine the powdered sugar, corn syrup, citrus oil or lemon/orange juice, and water (omit water if using juice instead of oil) in a small bowl and stir until smooth. Spoon about 1/2 teaspoon of glaze onto each cookie and use the back of the spoon to spread gently. Let the glaze harden for about 2 hours. Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days, but ideally consume as soon as possible after the glaze hardens.
