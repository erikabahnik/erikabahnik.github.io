<h3>Vanilla Panna Cotta with Passion Fruit Jelly</h3>
Passion fruit is my husband’s favorite fruit, and given the apropos name, I wanted to incorporate the flavor into our Valentine’s Day dessert. I kept it simple and used a bit of passion fruit jelly on top of a vanilla panna cotta. This recipe is not as sweet as some panna cotta recipes. Because the passion fruit jelly already adds so much tartness and sweetness, what I mainly wanted from the jiggly cream beneath was its creaminess. Panna cotta is the perfect make-ahead dessert. It is incredibly simple – just cream, gelatin and flavoring. All it needs is a few hours of chilling, and then how should it look? I will leave you with the words of <a href="http://www.nigella.com/">Nigella Lawson</a>, the Queen of Colorful Food Descriptions, who once said, “Panna cotta, when you put a spoon in it, should have the quiver of a 17th-century courtesan's inner thigh.”

Yield: 6 servings

<b>Ingredients:</b>

1 c. whole milk
1 packet powdered unflavored gelatin (¼ oz.)
3 c. heavy whipping cream
3 Tbsp. granulated sugar
1 tsp. <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-vanilla-extract-vanilla-bean-vanilla-paste-169336">vanilla paste</a>
¾ c. <a href="http://www.nuts.com/cookingbaking/spreads/jelly/passion-fruit.html">passion fruit jelly</a>
<h4><b>Method:</b></h4>
Pour the milk into a small saucepan. Sprinkle the gelatin evenly over the entire surface of the milk. Set aside for five minutes for the gelatin to bloom (soften).

Place the saucepan on the stove over medium heat. Stir gently and constantly for about five minutes, or until the gelatin has dissolved. Pour in the cream, sugar and vanilla paste, and stir to combine over the heat for another couple of minutes, until the entire mixture is heated through. Remove from the heat and cool for a few minutes.

Give the mixture a good stir to redistribute all the vanilla bean pieces, then immediately transfer to a measuring cup with a spout and pour even portions into six wine glasses. Cover each glass with a square of plastic wrap and chill for at least six hours.

Before serving, use a towel to wipe the condensation from the inside of each wine glass. Then top with a dollop of passion fruit jelly, about 2 tablespoons per serving, and serve immediately with a spoon. Panna cotta should be enjoyed within two days of making it, or else the quality of the texture will begin to deteriorate.

Since it was Valentine's Day, I served this with a little something extra on the side: strawberries that I dipped in chocolate and brushed with a bit of gold luster dust.
