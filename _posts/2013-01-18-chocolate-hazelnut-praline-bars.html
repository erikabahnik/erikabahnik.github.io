<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-259" alt="Chocolate Hazelnut Praline Bar" src="http://sweetfool.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC01898-Version-2-1024x680.jpg" width="590" height="391" />In a previous <a href="http://sweetfool.com/2013/01/hazelnut-shortbread/">post</a>, I alluded to my favorite flavor combination of chocolate and hazelnut. Today I offer up a recipe that celebrates it. The base is <a href="http://sweetfool.com/2013/01/hazelnut-shortbread/">hazelnut shortbread</a>, the middle layer is hazelnut praline paste, and the top is a simple but rich chocolate ganache. This is a new creation of mine, so if you take the time to make it, I would love to hear how it turns out. It is a bit labor intensive, but oh-so-worth-it. You can serve it as a plated dessert or cut into small squares to serve as small bites on a dessert table.
<h3>Chocolate Hazelnut Praline Bars</h3>
Yield: 8 pieces, 2 x 4 inches or 16 2 x 2 inch squares
<h4><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h4>
<strong>For the hazelnut praline paste:</strong>
½ lb. granulated sugar
½ lb. toasted hazelnuts
½ tsp. <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/product-spoligh-159336">grapeseed oil</a>
Pinch of salt

<strong>For the hazelnut shortbread:</strong>
1 c. hazelnuts
1 Tbsp. granulated sugar
½ c. (1 stick) butter, at room temperature
½ c. light brown sugar
¼ tsp. fine sea salt
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1 egg yolk, at room temperature
1 ¼ c. all-purpose flour

<strong>For the ganache:</strong>
8 oz. chocolate
5 oz. heavy whipping cream
1 Tbsp. softened butter, diced
<h4><strong>Method:</strong></h4>
<strong>To make the hazelnut praline paste:</strong>

Spread ½ lb. toasted hazelnuts evenly onto a baking sheet lined with a Silpat or parchment paper. Set aside near the stove.

Put ½ lb. sugar in a heavy-bottomed saucepan, the wider the better. Heat on medium and stir with a wooden spoon. It will take a few minutes before you see anything happening, but keep stirring. Once the sugar begins to liquefy, watch closely, as it won’t take long before it begins to color. Stir until the mixture turns golden brown all over and before it starts to smoke. Remove from the heat and immediately pour evenly over the hazelnuts. It should look something like this:

Let everything cool to room temperature.

Once it has cooled, break the pieces up and put into a food processor bowl. Pulse until it breaks up completely, then grind in long pulses, occasionally scraping down the sides with a spatula to keep the mixture even. This will take a few minutes. Eventually the oils from the nuts will begin to release and the mixture will begin to resemble a paste. At this point, add the grapeseed oil and combine well. Put into a glass or plastic storage container and set aside.

<strong>To make the hazelnut shortbread:</strong>

This is the same <a href="http://sweetfool.com/2013/01/hazelnut-shortbread/">recipe</a> I shared last week, but you only need half the dough. I don’t like to split recipes that call for a single egg or yolk, so I recommend that you save the other half of the dough to use as the base for another tart or for the <a href="http://sweetfool.com/2013/01/hazelnut-shortbread/">hazelnut shortbread cookies</a> from my previous post.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter the inside of an 8x8 baking dish. Put a piece of parchment paper on top so that it reaches outside the pan, serving as handles. Butter the top of the parchment as well. Set the dish aside.

Toast one cup of hazelnuts in a pan on the stove over medium low heat. Swirl the pan every minute or so to get an even toasting. Put hazelnuts in a small bowl and set aside to cool.
Once cool, grind the hazelnuts with 1 Tbsp. granulated sugar in a food processor until the mixture consists mostly of fine crumbs. Using a stand or hand mixer, cream ½ cup softened butter, ½ cup brown sugar and ¼ tsp. salt until fluffy. Scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula to reincorporate the mixture along the sides of the bowl. Add 1 tsp. vanilla and one egg yolk, and mix until combined. Scrape down the bowl again. Gently stir in the hazelnuts, and then the 1 ¼ cup flour.

Transfer one half of the mixture onto a large piece of plastic wrap and form into a log (if you plan to use it for cookies) or a disc (if you plan to use it for a future tart). Wrap tightly and refrigerate or freeze the dough depending on when you plan to use it.

Press the other half of the dough evenly into your prepared 8x8 baking dish. It should look like this:

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-260" alt="Hazelnut shortbread in pan" src="http://sweetfool.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC01860-1024x680.jpg" width="590" height="391" />
Use a toothpick or fork to poke several holes in the dough to avoid its rising in the oven. Bake at 350 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the edges are light golden brown and the top is pale golden brown. Set aside to cool. While the base cools, make the ganache.

<strong>To make the ganache:</strong>

Chop 8 oz. chocolate into small, easily dissolvable pieces and put into a medium-sized bowl, glass or metal.

Put 5 oz. heavy whipping cream in a small saucepan and heat on medium high. Just as the cream starts to boil, remove from the heat and pour over the chocolate. Let sit for five minutes, then whisk together in a circular motion, starting from the center. Once the mixture is all combined and smooth, whisk in the softened butter.

Let the ganache cool to room temperature.

<strong>Assembling the bars:</strong>

Once the tart shell has cooled, pour about 2/3 of the praline paste onto the tart shell and smooth out evenly with a small offset spatula. (You can also use the back of a spoon but a spatula is much easier to work with). Store the rest covered at room temperature in the refrigerator and use as a spread on toast or any other bread.

While the ganache is cooling, put the baking dish in the refrigerator to let the praline paste firm up a bit before adding the ganache. Once the ganache is at room temperature, give it one more quick whisk and pour over the praline paste layer. Smooth out with a spatula as evenly as possible.

Chill for at least two hours before cutting and serving. Take the dish out of the refrigerator about 20 minutes before you wish to serve the dessert so the ganache can soften a tiny bit before cutting (this will help prevent the top from cracking as you cut).

Serve any leftovers in the refrigerator and enjoy within one week.
