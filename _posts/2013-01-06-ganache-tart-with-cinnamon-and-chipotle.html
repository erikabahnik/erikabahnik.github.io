Ganache is one of those culinary terms that sounds fancy and complicated, but really, it is one of the easiest things to make. It is simply a mixture of chocolate and hot cream (or butter or egg, but here we'll focus on the most common version of ganache). The only tricks are not to overheat the cream and not to stir too vigorously or for longer than necessary while combining the cream and chocolate, or you risk breaking the ganache. (In this case, the fat would separate, which doesn't affect the flavor but would make your dessert unsightly.) I brought this tart on Saturday to a dinner party hosted by friends from Mexico City who were serving authentic (and spicy!) enchiladas verdes. In keeping with the theme, I chose cinnamon and chipotle for my flavorings, but you can experiment with different flavors by using similar amounts of your favorite spices.
<h3><strong>Ganache Tart with Cinnamon and Chipotle</strong></h3>
Yield: 8 servings
<h4><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h4>
<strong>For crust:</strong>
9-inch tart pan with removable bottom
Nonstick spray
5 oz. chocolate graham crackers
3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 Tbsp. honey

<strong>For ganache:</strong>
1 c. heavy whipping cream
12 oz. bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped into small pieces
1 Tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder
1 Tbsp. unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/4 tsp. cinnamon
1/2 tsp. ground chipotle pepper
Cinnamon sugar made with confectioner's sugar and cinnamon*, for dusting
<h4><strong>Method:</strong></h4>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Spray the inside of the tart pan with nonstick spray. In a food processor, grind the graham crackers, 3 tablespoons of butter, and honey until fine crumbs form. Pour the crumbs into the tart pan and press them evenly into the bottom (not up sides). Put the pan on a baking sheet and bake until set, 10 to 12 minutes. Set pan aside to cool.

While the crust cools, make the ganache. In a small saucepan, bring the cream to a boil over medium high heat, then immediately remove from the heat and set aside. Put the chocolate in a medium saucepan. Pour the cream into the saucepan with the chocolate and stir gently over medium-low heat just until all the chocolate is melted and the ganache is smooth. Gently stir in the cocoa powder, then the last tablespoon of butter, and finally the cinnamon and ground chipotle. Pour the ganache into the cooled crust. Refrigerate for two hours and cut into eight wedges before serving.

Make ahead: This tart can be made one day in advance. Once the tart is firm, simply cover with plastic wrap and keep refrigerated until ready to serve. Before serving, dust with a mixture of confectioner's sugar and cinnamon.

* Mix together confectioner's sugar and cinnamon in a ratio of 3 to 1 (i.e. 3 tsp. of sugar to 1 tsp. cinnamon). Keep in a shaker for dusting tarts, buttered toast, or the foam or whipped cream on your favorite hot beverage.
