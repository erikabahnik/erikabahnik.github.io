Making caramels is one of my favorite things to do. I remember falling in love with the process while I was simultaneously working as a chocolatier for <a href="http://kingsburychocolates.com/index.html">Kingsbury Chocolates</a> and apprenticing with (award-winning) Pastry Chef Heather Chittum at Hook Restaurant in Washington, D.C. At that time I was making at least a couple of large batches of caramel per week at the chocolate shop, and at Hook I was in charge of making the caramel for mini caramel apples that were part of a plated dessert. Heather once looked over at me and commented how content I looked making my caramel. And I really was. There is something so satisfying to me about the process of working with hot sugar. Not only is the end result worth the effort, but no matter how many pots of caramel I make, I am still fascinated by the alchemy of how sugar turns into something so delicious and altogether different in texture and flavor than the raw product. Although I learned the basics in pastry school, I have to credit Rob Kingsbury for teaching me all about caramel making (and also for being the nicest and happiest guy I know!). My recipe differs a bit from his, but I still use his method of bringing the caramel to a high temperature to get that deep golden color, before bringing it down to the firm ball stage (245-250 degrees F). Caramelizing the sugar in this way gives it a more complex flavor than if you simply cook it directly to its final temperature. Working with hot sugar can be tricky and takes a lot of practice, so please let me know if you have any questions if you decide to try it out.
<h3>Salted Caramels</h3>
Yield: About 187 one-inch caramels
<h4><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h4>
1 ½ c. corn syrup
4 c. sugar
½ c. water
1 tsp. white vinegar or lemon juice
1 c. unsalted butter (2 sticks)
3 c. heavy whipping cream
2 tsp <a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/tipstools/ingredients/2009/05/fleur_de_sel">fleur de sel</a>
1 ½ tsp. vanilla extract
<a href="http://food52.com/blog/3601-how-to-temper-chocolate">Tempered chocolate</a> for dipping (optional)
<h4><strong>Method:</strong></h4>
Place a Silpat onto a half sheet pan (13 x 18 inches). Set aside.

Heat the heavy cream in a glass measuring cup. (About two minutes in the microwave should do it, then stir). Set aside.

Pour the corn syrup into a wide and deep saucepan (I use a 6-quart Dutch oven). Add the sugar on top of the corn syrup, then pour the water on top of the sugar. Stir these together with a wooden spoon, somewhat gently to reduce the number of sugar crystals that end up on the sides of the pan. Be sure to stir thoroughly and scrape the bottom of the pan with the wooden spoon to ensure that no sugar crystals are stuck to the bottom. (Note: This is important since sugar crystals that don't dissolve into the mixture quickly can cause the entire mixture to crystallize, and this will ruin your caramel). Cover the pan tightly and bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. (Covering the pan will cause condensation, which will help to "wash" any sugar crystals down into the mixture.) Once the mixture begins to boil, add the vinegar or lemon juice (for extra insurance against crystallization).

Cook over medium heat until the mixture begins to turn golden. (I eyeball it at this stage, but if you wish to use a candy thermometer, it should register between 300 and 310). Keep an eye on it - once the sugar starts to color it can become dark quickly. Once it is a warm golden hue, remove the pot from the heat and add the butter, stirring with a spoon until the butter melts completely. Put the pot back on the heat at medium low and add the cream carefully. The mixture will bubble up violently, which is normal, but take care that hot sugar doesn't splatter on you. Add the vanilla and salt, give the mixture one last stir and insert a candy thermometer.

Make sure that your sheet pan is next to the stove on a heat proof surface. As soon as the candy thermometer reads between 248 (this should take 10 to 15 minutes at this point), remove the pot from the stove and immediately pour the caramel evenly into the prepared pan. Leave for several hours to cool.

Use a hard plastic spatula to release the edges of the caramel, then lift it onto a large cutting board. Cut into 1 to 1 1/2 inch squares. Set the cut pieces of caramel aside on a baking sheet or countertop lined with nonstick paper (wax paper or parchment) or with a silicone baking mat. You can wrap the caramel squares in wax paper squares, twisting the ends, or dip them in chocolate. Either way, a light sprinkle of fleur de sel is a nice way to top them off.

<em>For flavor variations, steep the cream for a few minutes in a nice aromatic (i.e. a chai tea bag, whole lavender buds, cloves, the possibilities are endless . . .)
