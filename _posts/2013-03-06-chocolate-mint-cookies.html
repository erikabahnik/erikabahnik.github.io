When it comes to St. Patrick’s Day treats, I like to keep the green subtle and the flavors big. This cookie features the classic combination of chocolate and mint, using Andes crème de menthe candies to add just a hint of green. This recipe is an exception to my usual practice of only using high quality chocolate in my cookies. For specialty holidays, I bend this rule a little and sometimes use commercial candies that hold nostalgia for me. As a child, I loved these little mints and still find them hard to resist today.
<h3>Chocolate Mint Cookies</h3>
Yield: About 50 cookies
<h4><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h4>
1 ¼ c. unsalted butter, softened
1 c. granulated sugar
1 c. light brown sugar
2 1/3 c. all-purpose flour
½ c. unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tsp. baking soda
½ tsp. fine sea salt
1 large egg, at room temperature
1 tsp. vanilla extract
¼ tsp. peppermint extract
2 boxes Andes mints (4.67 oz. each box), each mint chopped into 10 little squares
<h4><strong>Method:</strong></h4>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper and set aside.

In the bowl of a stand mixer using the paddle attachment, beat together the butter and sugars for a few minutes on medium speed until well blended and smooth.

While the butter and sugars are creaming, put together the dry ingredients. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Whisk together until evenly mixed.

Once the butter and sugars are well mixed, scrape down the mixer bowl with a rubber spatula, add the egg and mix on low to combine.  Add the vanilla and peppermint extracts and mix together. Scrape down the mixer bowl again and add the dry ingredients to the bowl. Mix until just combined. Stir in the Andes pieces.

Using a tablespoon scoop, scoop the dough onto the baking sheet, about two inches apart. Bake at 350 degrees F for 9 to 10 minutes, until just set, for a slightly chewy cookie.

Store in an airtight container for up to one week.
