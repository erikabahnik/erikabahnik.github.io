It is really lovely and looks more impressive than it is difficult to make. The crust is a basic chocolate tart shell, the filling features white chocolate and mascarpone cheese, and the topping is a simple mound of fresh gorgeous raspberries. Perhaps you'll want to make this sweet tart for your sweetheart!
<h3>Chocolate Raspberry Tart</h3>
Yield: 8 slices
<h4><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h4>
<strong> For the tart crust:</strong>

One 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom
1 ¼ c. all-purpose flour
2/3 c. granulated sugar
½ c. unsweetened cocoa powder
¼ tsp. fine sea salt
10 Tbsp. (1 ¼ sticks) unsalted butter, cold and diced
1 ½ Tbsp. very cold water
<strong>
For the filling:</strong>

3 oz. white chocolate
1 c. mascarpone cheese
1/3 c. heavy whipping cream
2 Tbsp. confectioner’s sugar
¼ tsp. vanilla extract
1 ½ pints fresh raspberries
<h4><strong>Method:</strong></h4>
Butter the inside of the tart pan. Put the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a food processor and pulse a couple times to combine. Add the butter and blend until the dough has a sandy texture. Add the cold water and blend until the dough comes together. Press the dough evenly into the pan and up the sides. Put the tart pan in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to chill the dough.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Poke a few holes in the bottom of the crust with a fork, then place the tart pan on a baking sheet and bake until it looks dry across the top, about 18 minutes. Set the tart pan aside on a wire rack to cool completely.

While the crust cools, prepare the tart filling. Put the white chocolate in a glass bowl and microwave for one minute at 50% power. Stir the chocolate and put back in the microwave at 50% power, 30 seconds at a time, stirring after each 30-second interval, until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Set aside to cool slightly.

Place the mascarpone cheese, heavy cream, confectioner’s sugar, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer. Use the paddle attachment and blend on medium low speed until the mixture is well blended and rather firm. Fold in the cooled melted white chocolate and pour into the cooled tart shell, using a rubber spatula to get all the mixture from the bowl. Place the raspberries on top of the filling in concentric circle, finishing with a small mound in the center. You may not need all the raspberries.

Chill until ready to cut and serve. For best results, this tart should be served the same day you make it.
