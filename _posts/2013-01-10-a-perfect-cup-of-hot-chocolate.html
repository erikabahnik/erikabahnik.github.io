<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-146" alt="Hot Chocolate" src="http://sweetfool.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC01770-1024x680.jpg" width="590" height="391" />While I'm currently involved in a love affair with my new Nespresso machine, my true love (hot beverage-wise) is hot chocolate. Chocolate junkie that I am, there are few things more satisfying to me on a cold day than a lovingly prepared cup of this decadent stuff. Sometimes it's a breakfast beverage. Or dessert. Or an afternoon treat. There's really no wrong time, is there? I have experimented with many recipes, but for me, simplest is best. When going the simple route, the quality of ingredients makes all the difference, so please, use good chocolate when making hot chocolate. I prefer dark chocolate, so I personally use 60% or higher cacao content, but a good semi-sweet chocolate with 55% is wonderful as well. (Note: If you don't see the % of cacao on your chocolate, there probably isn't enough to deem it "good.") Depending on how sweet your chocolate is, you may need to play with the amount of sugar you add in order to get the right balance of sweetness. My recipe is for one serving so that you can treat yourself without having to do math. ;-) However, it can easily be scaled up if you want to share.
<h3><b>Hot Chocolate
</b></h3>
Yield: One perfect cup
<h4><b>Ingredients:</b></h4>
1 c. milk (ideally whole milk, but I understand if New Year's resolutions make you choose reduced fat)
2 oz. chocolate (55% or greater cacao content), chopped into small, easily dissolvable pieces
1 tsp. confectioner's sugar (or more to your taste, depending on how sweet your chocolate is)
1/4 tsp. vanilla extract
1/8 tsp. ground cinnamon (optional)
Generous pinch of salt
Crème chantilly (the French term for sweetened whipped cream with a splash of vanilla)
Cinnamon sugar
<h4><b>Method:</b></h4>
Heat the milk in a small saucepan over low heat and bring to a gentle simmer. Give it a whisk every few minutes to ensure the milk isn't sticking to the bottom of the pan. Once the milk is hot, add the chocolate and immediately whisk until it is all dissolved. Whisk in the confectioner's sugar, then the vanilla, salt and cinnamon. Serve in a large mug with enough room for a dollop of crème chantilly (again, this is simply sweetened whipped cream with a splash of vanilla) and a sprinkling of cinnamon sugar. Mine is pictured in a pink Longaberger mug for breast cancer awareness. (PSA break: Ladies, get your mammograms!)
