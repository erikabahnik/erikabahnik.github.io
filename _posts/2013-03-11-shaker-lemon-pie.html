Recently, a friend in New York texted me to ask what my favorite brunch place was. I began to reminisce about my old NYC haunts, recalling brunches at Sarabeth’s, Isabella’s, Norma’s. My friend replied that she thought they would go to <a href="http://www.bubbys.com">Bubby’s</a>. My reply: Now THAT is my real favorite. I lived uptown and didn’t get to Bubby’s in Tribeca near enough, but I savored it when I did get the chance. As I lived vicariously through my friend’s descriptions of what she ate later that day, I went to Bubby’s website to swoon over their current menu. Going through the site, I stumbled upon the recipe for this <a href="http://www.bubbys.com/briefs/shaker-lemon-pie-a-history-and-a-recipe/">Shaker Lemon Pie</a>. It sounded like the perfect winter pie. I love citrus, and this is a unique way of using lemons – macerating them overnight in sugar, then mixing them (peel, pith and all) with an egg mixture before turning it into a pie shell and topping with another layer of crust. The result is altogether different from anything I’ve ever tasted. I’ve heard it described as somewhere between lemon marmalade and lemon curd. To me, it’s like a candied lemon peel pie. The texture and pungent flavor wouldn’t be for everyone, but if you are a true lemon lover, or love candied citrus peels, you would likely adore this pie.

Yield: 8 slices

<b>Ingredients:
</b>

2 large lemons
2 c. granulated sugar
¼ tsp. fine sea salt
4 large eggs
4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted and cooled
3 Tbsp. all-purpose flour
1 9-inch double crust (<a href="http://sweetfool.com/2013/03/apple-crostata/">I used a double batch of the dough I used for my apple crostata. Click here for the recipe.</a>)
1 egg white, whipped until frothy
Coarse sugar for sprinkling (I used demerara sugar)

<b>Method:</b>

The day before you wish to bake this pie, prepare the lemon mixture so that it can macerate overnight. Wash and dry the lemons, then zest them into a medium-sized bowl. Slice the zestless lemons as thin as possible (a mandolin is ideal for this purpose, but you can also use a very sharp knife, as I did). Remove the seeds as you slice and place the lemon slices into the bowl with the zest. Pour the 2 cups of sugar on top along with the ¼ teaspoon of salt and mix well with a spoon. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave on the counter at room temperature for 24 hours.

Once you are ready to assemble your pie, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Roll out the pie dough to 9 inches round and place one round into a 9-inch pie plate, leaving a bit of overhang.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, melted butter and flour. Add to the lemon mixture and stir well. Pour the combined mixture into the pie shell. Place the second dough round on top, fold the edges under the bottom crust, and crimp. Using a paring knife, make four slits in the top crust. Brush the crust with the whipped egg white and sprinkle all over with coarse sugar. Bake at 425 degrees F for 25 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F and continue baking for another 20 minutes until the crust is very golden. Set aside to cool on a wire rack and serve at room temperature.

I have to admit that I wasn’t able to wait until the pie cooled before slicing into it, as I was curious to taste it warm from the oven. As a result, the photo of the slice is a little oozier than it would have been had I waited for it to cool. But it was equally delicious warm as at room temp, and the texture didn’t vary too much.
