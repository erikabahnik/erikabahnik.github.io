I've been busy making lots of Easter chocolates for a project I'll post tomorrow, but I wanted to take a minute to share a photo of my son's Easter basket this year, before Easter comes and goes! He's not even two yet, so I kept it small and simple. I made his chocolate Easter bunny from a classic bunny mold and brushed it with gold luster dust. The chocolate bar in the back is studded with Cadbury mini eggs (I wait all year for those). There is one Cadbury creme egg (I'll be eating that one . . .) and a plastic egg containing a couple dollars and a few coins for his piggy bank. He is really into Mickey Mouse Clubhouse at the moment, so the main gift is a set of activity blocks from the show. Lastly I tucked in a cute and fun pop-up lion toothbrush - incentive to get those pearly whites back in shape after all that chocolate indulging! After he opens the basket on Sunday morning, he will use it to hold real eggs for his first Easter egg hunt with his grandparents, visiting from Paris.

Happy Easter, everyone!
