<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-125" alt="DSC01757" src="http://sweetfool.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC01757-1024x680.jpg" width="590" height="391" />Aside from chocolate, hazelnut is probably my most favorite flavor on earth. (Combine the two, and I’m pretty much floating on a cloud. But that’s for another post . . .). I first made this classic slice-and-bake cookie when I was testing recipes for my Sweet Fool cookie line. It wasn’t the texture I was looking for at the time, but I tucked away the recipe, knowing it would be perfect as a coffee accompaniment.  This is a humble little cookie – certainly good, but not very exciting on its own. When paired with a cappuccino, however, it is perfection. With a pleasing balance of salty and sweet, the texture is at first crunchy and then almost melts in your mouth once dipped into a hot cup of Joe. I made these today to take to a friend’s place, as we are both currently obsessed with our new Nespresso machines, and I knew she would appreciate the combination as much as I did.
<h3><b>Hazelnut Shortbread
</b></h3>
Yield: About 45 cookies, more or less depending on width
<h4><b>Ingredients</b>:</h4>
1 c. hazelnuts
1 Tbsp. granulated sugar
1/2 c. (1 stick) butter, at room temperature
1/2 c. light brown sugar
1/4 tsp. fine sea salt
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1 egg yolk, at room temperature
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
<h4><b>Method:</b></h4>
Toast the hazelnuts in a pan on the stove over medium low heat. Swirl the pan every minute or so to get an even toasting. Put hazelnuts in a small bowl and set aside to cool.

Once cool, grind the hazelnuts with the granulated sugar in a food processor until the mixture consists mostly of fine crumbs. Using a stand or hand mixer, cream the butter, brown sugar and salt until fluffy. Scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula to reincorporate the mixture along the sides of the bowl. Add the vanilla and egg yolk, and mix until combined. Scrape down the bowl again. Gently stir in the hazelnuts, and then the flour.

Transfer half of the mixture onto a large piece of plastic wrap and form into a log, 1 ½ to 2 inches wide. Wrap the plastic tightly around your log and roll it on the countertop in order to get the edges as rounded as possible (or you can form the sides into squares).  Refrigerate immediately and repeat with the second half of the mixture, so that you end up with two logs in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the logs for at least one hour and preferably two or more (they will be easier to cut).

When you are ready to bake the cookies, preheat your oven to 350 degrees F and pull out two baking sheets lined with silicone mats or parchment paper. Once your oven is ready, remove one log from the refrigerator at a time. Cut each log into about 1/4 inch slices and place on each baking sheet, about two inches apart. (Because the nuts make this a crumbly cookie, you may need to reshape each cookie gently before you place it on the baking sheet. Bake until the tops are lightly browned, usually 12-15 minutes (start checking at 12 minutes). After about five minutes, transfer the cookies to a cooling rack to cool completely.

Store in an airtight container for up to one week.
