My baby boy turned two last weekend, and we celebrated at home with a few family and friends. I decided to go traditional this year with classic vanilla birthday cupcakes and a simple vanilla buttercream. My son loves this combination, and I find it pretty hard to beat too. I usually use cake flour for cupcakes, but the <a href="http://www.magnoliabakery.com/">Magnolia Bakery</a> recipe calls for all-purpose so I stayed true to that. Even with regular flour, the gentle mixing method of alternating dry ingredients with whole milk makes for a wonderful texture that retains its freshness even a couple days later.
<h3>Traditional Vanilla Birthday Cupcakes</h3>
<em>Adapted from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Magnolia-Bakery-Cookbook-Old-Fashioned/dp/0684859106/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369407069&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=magnolia+bakery+cookbook">Magnolia Bakery Cookbook</a></em>

Yield: 24 cupcakes

<b>For the cupcakes:</b>

<b>Ingredients:</b>

1 c. (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 c. granulated sugar
4 large eggs, at room temperature
2 3/4 c. all-purpose flour
2 1/4 tsp. baking powder
3/4 tsp. fine salt
1 c. whole milk, at room temperature
1 tsp. vanilla extract

<strong>Method:</strong>

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Line 2 muffin pans with 24 paper baking cups (I used Toy Story baking cups for our party's theme). Set aside.

Measure out the flour, baking powder and salt and combine in a large bowl. Whisk to combine. Set aside.

In the large bowl of a stand mixer and using the paddle attachment, cream the butter until smooth. Gradually add the sugar and mix for a few minutes until fluffy. Crack one egg into a small bowl and add to the creamed mixture. Repeat with each egg individually, mixing well after each addition and scraping down the bowl with a rubber spatula after every two eggs. Add 1/4 of the flour mixture and mix well. Add 1/4 c. of milk and mix well. Repeat until all flour and milk is incorporated, scraping down the bowl occasionally. Add the vanilla extract and mix one more time, and your batter is done.

Divide the batter evenly into the muffin pans (they should be just about 3/4 full). Bake for 20 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean and the tops spring back when touched gently. Let the cupcakes cool in the pans for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. They should be completely cool before icing.

<strong>For the buttercream:</strong>

<strong>Ingredients:</strong>

1 c. (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
8 c. confectioner's sugar (about a 1 lb. box), sifted
1/2 c. whole milk, at room temperature
2 tsp. vanilla extract
Food coloring and sprinkles (optional)

<strong>Method:</strong>

In the large bowl of a stand mixer, add the butter and mix until smooth. Add 4 cups of the sugar, the milk and vanilla extract and mix until smooth and creamy. Scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula. Gradually add the rest of the sugar, about 1 cup at a time, until the icing is thick enough to pipe or spread onto the cupcakes. (Note: you most likely will not need all of the sugar. 5 to 6 cups will usually give you the right consistency, but if you need more icing, you can add the rest of the sugar. I iced 32 cupcakes and using 8 cups of sugar was the perfect amount for all of those). Optional: add a few drops of food coloring and mix together. Add more drops if necessary to achieve the desired color. Ice the cupcakes either using a piping bag with star tip (as I did here), or spread on the buttercream using a small spatula. Finish with colorful sugar or festive sprinkles.

<strong>Storage:</strong>

The cupcakes can be made the day before you need them, but ideally you should ice them the day of. Store them in a covered container for up to two days after baking. Extra icing can be stored in an airtight container for up to three days at room temperature.
