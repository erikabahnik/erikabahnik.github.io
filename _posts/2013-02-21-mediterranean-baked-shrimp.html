After the influx of Valentine sweets, I thought it was time to take a break and do a little savory baking. I love baking for dinner, especially when spices are involved. The flavors really get a chance to infuse the food, and in a relatively short time you can have a gorgeous dinner on the table. This is a dish I like to make for guests. One friend in particular often requests it, so we had it last night. It doesn't require much work before baking. Simply prepare a sauce on the stovetop, let it thicken, then transfer the sauce, shrimp, cheese and herbs to a baking dish, and into the oven it goes. I like to serve it over simple basmati or jasmine rice.
<h3>Mediterranean Baked Shrimp</h3>
Yield: 4 dinner portions
<h4><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h4>
1 medium yellow onion, diced
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 Tbsp. olive oil
½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes (just 1/4 tsp. if you want it less spicy)
½ tsp. ground cinnamon
¼ tsp. ground allspice
28 oz. diced canned tomatoes (use both the tomato pieces and juice)
1 lb. large peeled and deveined shrimp
¾ c. crumbled feta cheese
1 tsp. dry oregano
Coarse salt
<h4><strong>Method:</strong></h4>
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium low heat. Add the onion, garlic and ¼ teaspoon salt and sauté until the onion is soft and translucent, about five minutes. Add the cinnamon, allspice and red pepper flakes, and stir. Let the spices cook for about one minute. Add the tomatoes and their juice and simmer on medium low, uncovered, until thickened, about 20 minutes. Stir occasionally as it cooks.

As the 20-minute mark approaches, season the shrimp with a couple of generous pinches of salt, then stir into the tomato sauce. Transfer to an 8 x 8 inch baking dish and top with the feta and oregano. Bake until just cooked through, about 18 minutes. The shrimp should be pink and opaque, and the sauce should bubble slightly around the edges.

Serve immediately over white rice.
